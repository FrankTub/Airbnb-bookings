## Installation

In order to be able to execute your own python statements it should be noted that scripts are only tested on **anaconda distribution 4.5.11** in combination with **python 3.6.6**. The scripts don't require additional python libraries.

Two quick start options are available:
- [Download the latest release.](https://github.com/FrankTub/AirBNB/zipball/master/)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/FrankTub/AirBNB.git`

## Project motivation
For the second term of the nanodegree [become a data scientist](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) of [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/) I got involved in this project. I was particular interested in identifying some tips and tricks for people who want to make their house more attractable to rent through [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).  

## File descriptions

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files.

```

- seattle_airbnb.ipynb ==> Notebook to investigate trends of bookings on Airbnb in the year 2016 in Seattle.
- utility.py           ==> Python helper functions, they are used in the notebook.
- calendar.csv         ==> Booking information of houses in Seattle.
- listings.csv         ==> Information of houses in Seattle.
- reviews.csv          ==> Reviews of houses in Seattle.

## Results
The most popular house size in Seattle are houses for 6 or 10 persons. Tourist prefer to rent an entire house over a private room and a shared room. Having a strict cancellation policy leads to reduced interest of clients. Seattle is the most popular around the turn of the year.
